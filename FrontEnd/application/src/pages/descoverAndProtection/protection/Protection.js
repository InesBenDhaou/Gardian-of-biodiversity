If we don't help, these amazing animals and plants might disappear forever. We need to work together to keep these special places safe. Saving them isn't just a choiceâ€”it's really important. When we take care of these places, we're also taking care of our world. It's like protecting a treasure so everyone can enjoy it, now and in the future.How so ?
